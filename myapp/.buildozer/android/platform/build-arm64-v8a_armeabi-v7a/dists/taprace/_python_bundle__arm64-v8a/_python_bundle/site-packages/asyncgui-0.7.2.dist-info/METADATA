# AsyncGui

...is a minimalistic async library that:

- does not provide features involving system calls, such as I/O, time retrieval, thread suspension, or thread spawning.
- has no external dependencies when using Python 3.11 or later.
- does not own a main loop, but is designed to integrate with an existing one.
- avoids global state.
- focuses on fast responsiveness, allowing immediate task start and resumption.
- offers powerful structured concurrency APIs inspired by [Trio](https://trio.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and [trio-util](https://trio-util.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
- has nothing to do with GUIs, even though it has 'gui' in its name. (Yes, I should rename it at some point.)
